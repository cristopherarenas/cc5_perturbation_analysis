Perturbation Analysis for Parabolic Partial Differential Equations

# About
This is a study and development of numerical methods realized during the Master of Science in Computer Science Engineering.

The perturbation analysis consist in determine the effect of the introduction of small factors into equations, in this case a general model of parabolic partial differential equation, and how numerical simulations with different methods, using one or two scales of time, are obtaining good or bad approximations.

The method studied uses different multiscales of time to show that small factors can produce differences when time tends to be long. A comparison with other method (including an spectral method) is realized in the final part.

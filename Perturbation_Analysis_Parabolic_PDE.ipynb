    "As can be seen, the solution is the usual for a diffusion equation. The difference with traditional approaches is that the horizontal axis corresponds to a time variable that measures the delay to be applied to the function $\\Theta(t)$ such that $\\theta = 0$. Recalling that the $s$ that corresponds to a certain $\\hat{\\theta}$ is given by $s = \\tau - \\alpha$ with $\\alpha$ such that $\\Theta(\\alpha) = \\hat{\\theta}$, for some values of $\\tau$ the value of $s$ needed is negative. However, the variable is periodic on the interval $[0,P]$ and applying the modulo operator, the $s$ appears in the plot nearer of $P$ for the right side. For example, consider $T = \\tau = 0$ and the displacement $\\theta = \\pi/2$. The value of $\\alpha$ such that $\\Theta(\\alpha) = \\pi/2$ is $\\alpha = \\pi/2$ and the value of $s$ in this case is $s = 0 - \\pi/2 = -\\pi/2$. Using the periodicity of variable $s$ the value delivered to make next calculations is $s = (-\\pi/2)\\%2\\pi = 3\\pi/2$. The expected displacement of the advection process is realized because with a fixed value of displacement $\\theta$ in different moments of time, the value of $s$ obtained is different and moves around the values $[0,P]$."
